## Repository Structure

This section provides a brief description of the purpose of each file in the repository and explains how the files interact with each other. For example, the *simple_web_scraping_example.py* file contains a basic Python script that demonstrates how to fetch HTML content from a website using the `requests` library. In this case, since there is only one Python file, there is no interaction between different Python files.

2. Run `pip install requests` to install the required package.
3. Run `python simple_web_scraping_example.py`.
